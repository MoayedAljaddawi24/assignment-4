# AI Usage Report

## Assignment 1 Summary

Early in the project, AI tools helped with:
- Generating starter HTML/CSS layouts.
- Validating responsive design and accessibility choices.
- Explaining CSS grid/flex snippets.
- Performing minor debugging through ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot.

**Learning outcome:** Used AI mainly for concept reinforcement instead of copy/paste.

## Assignment 2 Usage

### Tools
- **ChatGPT (GPT-5)** — brainstorming features, writing snippets, accessibility advice.
- **GitHub Copilot** — inline suggestions in VS Code.
- **Replit Ghostwriter** — quick syntax hints.

### Use Cases
1. Planning the transition from Assignment 1 requirements to the new interactive expectations.
2. Scaffolding filter/search logic, collapsible details, and quote API patterns.
3. Requesting ARIA recommendations and reduced-motion best practices.
4. Drafting documentation outlines (later reviewed/edited manually).

### Benefits & Challenges
- Faster ideation and better accessibility awareness.
- Still needed to refactor AI-generated JS to fit the DOM and ensure academic integrity.

### Learning Outcomes
- Practiced responsible AI usage for ideation rather than blind copy.
- Improved explanations of AI outputs to peers/instructors.
- Deepened understanding of fetch/localStorage/ARIA fundamentals.

## Assignment 3 Usage

### Tools
- **ChatGPT (GPT-5)** — ideated advanced features (GitHub feed, favorites, AI coach), generated copy for new sections, and authored the action plans stored in `assets/data/ai-insights.json`.
- **GitHub Copilot** — assisted with complex JS (favorites, sorting, AI coach logic) and accessibility tweaks.

### AI Career Coach Dataset
- Prompted ChatGPT: _“Generate actionable portfolio improvement plans for a CS student based on goals (showcase/network/learn) and time windows (short/long). Include a title, summary paragraph, and two bullet actions.”_
- Curated and edited the responses, then saved them to `assets/data/ai-insights.json`.
- The front-end loads this dataset to power the on-page AI Career Coach, so no external AI API is called at runtime.

### Additional Uses
- Asked AI for advice on lazy-loading, skip-link placement, and reduce-motion handling.
- Used ChatGPT to proofread README/testing documentation for clarity and tone.
